    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="center">
        The poor and peasant tradition of Valtellina is found in a typical dish known and appreciated throughout Italy. Pizzoccheri della Valtellina PGI are a pasta made from buckwheat flour. Their origin has been known since 1750. Coming from Siberia, buckwheat has been grown in Valtellina since 1600.

        The jealous guardian of the original recipe of this typical dish is the Accademia del Pizzocchero di Teglio.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 gr. buckwheat flour</li>
         <li>100 gr. white flour</li>
        <li>200 gr. butter</li>
        <li>250 gr. Valtellina Casera DOP cheese</li>
        <li>150 gr. grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>200 gr. cabbage</li>
        <li>250 gr. potatoes</li>
        <li>a clove of garlic</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the two flours, knead them with water and work for about 5 minutes. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to a thickness of 2-3 millimetres, from which you obtain strips of 7-8 centimetres. Overlap the strips and cut them widthwise, obtaining tagliatelle about 5 millimetres wide.</li>
        <li>Cook the vegetables in salted water, the cabbage in small pieces and the potatoes in cubes, add the pizzoccheri after 5 minutes (the potatoes are always present, while the cabbage can be replaced, depending on the season, with chard or green beans).</li>
        <li>After about ten minutes, collect the pizzoccheri with the slotted spoon and pour part of it into a very hot baking pan, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and flakes of Valtellina Casera DOP , continue alternating pizzoccheri and cheese. Fry the butter with the garlic, letting it brown well, before pouring it over the pizzoccheri.</li>
        <li>Without stirring, serve the pizzoccheri piping hot with a sprinkling of pepper.</li>
        <li>To make Valtellina Casera even more stringy, in some homes the pan is placed in a hot oven for a few minutes before serving the pizzoccheri.</li>
