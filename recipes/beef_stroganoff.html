    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Beef Stroganoff is a delicious second course of Russian origin made with chopped beef cooked with wilted onion and mushrooms.
        The peculiarity of Stroganoff is the addition of sour cream at the end of cooking, which binds the flavors together and goes well with all the ingredients.
        There are two legends surrounding the origin of this dish: some say it was prepared for the first time by a French chef, personal chef of the Russian Count Pavel Stroganoff, who added sour cream to the classic beef fricassee to make it closer to the Count's tastes. The dish was a success and was named after the Count, in his honor according to a tradition of the time. Others say that Stroganoff was the name of the doctor who treated Tsarina Maria's herring poisoning with a diet of beef, onions and sour cream.
        Beef Stroganoff is a hearty, tasty dish that makes a great winter meal... serve it as a main course with some fluffy pirozhki!
