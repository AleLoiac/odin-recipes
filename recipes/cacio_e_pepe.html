    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>"Yes, life is a bite, here you bite well".</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is one of the typical phrases that introduce the menus in Roman trattorias or fraschette. But Carbonara and Amatriciana , like spaghetti cacio e pepe, have now become symbolic dishes of Italianness, made with DOP ingredients linked to the traditions of the territories in which they were born. An excellence that from the "checkered tablecloths" arrives in the kitchens of great Chefs, as in the case of spaghetti cacio, pepe and sea urchins . We also want to pay homage to one of the symbols of good and genuine eating, showing you how to make a perfect cacio e pepe! The chemical combination of water and Pecorino proteins, essential for obtaining a cream without lumps, the whole peppercorns crushed at the moment and toasted in a pan to release all their pungent aroma, the pasta slowly stirred to absorb all the flavor of Pecorino Romano... and above all, prepare and enjoy: another rule for enjoying spaghetti cacio e pepe at its best!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thick spaghetti 320 g</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano DOP medium seasoning, to grate 200 g</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns 5 g</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the spaghetti cacio e pepe, first put a pot of water on the stove to cook the pasta: fill it with about half the water you usually use, this way it will be richer in starch. In the meantime, grate the Pecorino Romano and transfer almost all of it into a bowl, keeping some aside for plating. When the water has come to a boil, add a little salt and plunge the spaghetti in. Meanwhile, crush the peppercorns with a meat tenderizer (or use a grinder, leaving it quite slow so as to also have larger pieces of pepper).</li>
        <li>Pour the pepper into a large non-stick pan and toast it over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon. Blend with a couple of ladles of the pasta cooking water. Continue stirring over low heat.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti 2-3 minutes before the time indicated on the package and transfer them to the pan, taking care to keep the cooking water. Finish cooking the spaghetti in the pan, risotto them, then adding hot water as needed and stirring continuously with tongs. Wait until the bottom of the pan is almost dry before adding more water.</li>
        <li>You can prepare the Pecorino cream (don't start before because it would tend to thicken or be too cold compared to the temperature of the pasta): pour a ladle of hot cooking water into the bowl with the grated Pecorino, then mix vigorously with a hand whisk. The consistency you should obtain is more pasty than creamy, don't worry if it is very dry. If once the cream is ready the pasta is not ready for mixing, briefly place the bowl on the pan with the hot water while continuing to mix with the whisk, so as to have the cream at a similar temperature to that of the pasta.</li>
        <li>When the spaghetti is cooked, turn off the heat and add the Pecorino cream, stirring continuously with tongs. For the ideal creaminess, adjust by adding more Pecorino or a little cooking water as needed. Serve your spaghetti cacio e pepe sprinkled with the remaining grated Pecorino and more freshly ground pepper to taste!</li>
