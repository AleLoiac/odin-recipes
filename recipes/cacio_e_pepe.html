    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>"Yes, life is a bite, here you bite well".</em>
    </p>

        This is one of the typical phrases that introduce the menus in Roman trattorias or fraschette. But Carbonara and Amatriciana , like spaghetti cacio e pepe, have now become symbolic dishes of Italianness, made with DOP ingredients linked to the traditions of the territories in which they were born. An excellence that from the "checkered tablecloths" arrives in the kitchens of great Chefs, as in the case of spaghetti cacio, pepe and sea urchins . We also want to pay homage to one of the symbols of good and genuine eating, showing you how to make a perfect cacio e pepe! The chemical combination of water and Pecorino proteins, essential for obtaining a cream without lumps, the whole peppercorns crushed at the moment and toasted in a pan to release all their pungent aroma, the pasta slowly stirred to absorb all the flavor of Pecorino Romano... and above all, prepare and enjoy: another rule for enjoying spaghetti cacio e pepe at its best!
